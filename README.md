Problem Statement
=================  

A squad of robots will be landed on a plateau. This plateau, which is curiously 
rectangular, must be navigated by the robots so that their on-board cameras can 
get a complete view of the surrounding terrain to send back to controller.  

A robot's position and location is represented by a combination of x and y 
co-ordinates and a letter representing one of the four cardinal compass points. 
The plateau is divided up into a grid to simplify navigation. An example 
position might be 0, 0, N, which means the robots is in the bottom left corner 
and facing North.  

In order to control a robot, Controller sends a simple string of letters. The 
possible letters are 'L', 'R' and 'M'. 'L' and 'R' makes the rover spin 90 
degrees left or right respectively, without moving from its current spot. 
'M' means move forward one grid point, and maintains the same heading.  

Assume that the square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1).  

INPUT:
------

The first line of input is the upper-right coordinates of the plateau, the 
lower-left coordinates are assumed to be 0,0.  

The rest of the input is information pertaining to the robots that have been 
deployed. Each robot has two lines of input. The first line gives the robot's 
position, and the second line is a series of instructions telling the robot how 
to explore the plateau. The position is made up of two integers and a letter 
separated by spaces, corresponding to the x and y co-ordinates and the robot's 
orientation.

OUTPUT
------

The output for each rover should be its final co-ordinates and heading.

INPUT AND OUTPUT
